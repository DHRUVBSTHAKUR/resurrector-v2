**An autonomous AI workforce that hunts bugs, patches code, and audits itself—while you sleep.**

### 🎥 Watch Level 4 Autonomy in Action
*The agent intercepts a critical Runtime Crash (ZeroDivisionError), attempts a fix, negotiates with the Security Auditor to ensure safety, and hot-patches the production code without human intervention.*

## 🛑 The Challenge: CI/CD Fragility

Modern CI/CD pipelines are fragile. A missing dependency, a forgotten colon, or a logic error can halt production for hours while on-call engineers scramble.

> **The Solution:** A Multi-Agent AI System that doesn't just "suggest" code—it spins up a secure sandbox, reproduces the crash, fixes it, and **verifies the fix** against a rigorous security audit before merging.


## 🧠 System Architecture (Level 4 Autonomy)

This isn't a simple chatbot. It is a **Self-Correcting Reasoning Loop** built on **LangGraph**.

## 🎛️ Mission Control Center
I built a dedicated dashboard to monitor the autonomous workforce in real-time. It tracks token usage, accumulated costs (USD), and live reasoning logs as the agents work.

![Autonomous Control Dashboard](assets/dashboard_ui.png)

### 🎭 The Cast
1.  **👷‍♂️ Agent A: The Junior DevOps (Execution)**
    * **Role:** The "Hands." Reads `stderr` logs, locates files, and injects fixes.
    * **Constraint:** Must provide "Proof of Work" (successful execution logs) before submitting.
    * **Engine:** `Gemini 2.0 Flash` (P50 Latency: 1.3s).

2.  **🛡️ Agent B: The Principal Security Engineer (Audit)**
    * **Role:** The "Eyes." Reviews the PR for security risks (e.g., `rm -rf`, infinite loops).
    * **Power:** Can **REJECT** the fix and force Agent A to retry.
    * **Engine:** `Gemini 2.0 Flash` (Strict Prompting).

## 📊 The "Gauntlet": Performance Benchmark
I subjected the system to a regression suite of 3 distinct failure modes. It achieved a **100% Success Rate** with zero human intervention.

| Failure Mode | Bug Type | Agent Behavior | Time-to-Fix | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Missing Lib** | `ImportError` | Installed dependency via `pip` | **~2.9s** | ✅ PASSED |
| **Syntax Error** | `SyntaxError` | Parsed trace, inserted colon | **~2.3s** | ✅ PASSED |
| **Logic Crash** | `ZeroDivision` | **REJECTED** 1st attempt → Refactored → **APPROVED** | **~5.4s** | ✅ PASSED |

> **📉 Cost Efficiency:** The entire regression suite runs for **<$0.01** using Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Engineering
* **Orchestration:** [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) (Stateful Multi-Agent Loops)
* **Sandboxing:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Ephemeral Execution Environments)
* **Intelligence:** [Google Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) (Multimodal Reasoning)— Chosen for its sub-second latency and massive context window, allowing agents to parse thousands of log lines for <$0.01 per run.
* **Observability:** [Arize Phoenix](https://phoenix.arize.com/) (OpenTelemetry Tracing)
* **Notifications:** [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) (Voice Alerts on Success)

## 🔬 Observability (The "X-Ray")
Every thought, tool call, and state transition is traced live via **Arize Phoenix**. This allows for deep inspection of "why" an agent failed or succeeded.

* **Green Checkmarks:** Successful reasoning steps & tool execution.
* **Latency Tracking:** P50 of ~1.3s ensures rapid feedback loops.
* **Cost Monitoring:** Detailed token counting per step (<$0.01 per fix).

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the agents, ensure you have:
1. **Docker Desktop** installed and running (for the sandboxed execution environment).
2. **Python 3.10+** installed.
3. **uv** package manager (`pip install uv`).

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/DHRUVBSTHAKUR/resurrector-v2.git](https://github.com/DHRUVBSTHAKUR/resurrector-v2.git)
cd resurrector-v2
uv sync  # Installs dependencies fast

## 2. Configure Secrets

Create a `.env` file:

```ini
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_key"

# Optional: Receive a real-time phone call when a fix is deployed 📞
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="optional"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="optional"


## 3. Unleash the Agents

```bash
uv run benchmark.py
```

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [x] **Self-Healing Loop:** Logic error rejection and retry
- [x] **Secure Sandbox:** Docker containerization
- [x] **Observability Dashboard:** Real-time tracing with Arize Phoenix
- [ ] **IDE Extension:** VS Code sidebar for one-click fixes
- [ ] **Multi-Language Support:** Expanding to Rust and Go
